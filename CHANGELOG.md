## Unreleased

### Added

- Add support to read non-manifold meshes by duplicating vertices
- Add SurfaceFactory class to generate basic shapes. Thanks to
  [u/lycium](https://www.reddit.com/user/lycium/) on Reddit for suggesting a
  simplification of the `icosahedron()` function.
- Add support to render colors per face
- Add support to render colors per vertex, thanks to Xiewei Zhong
- Add function to compute volume of a mesh, thanks to Xiewei Zhong
- Add post-increment iterators and make low level functions to add elements
  public. This makes it possible to use CGAL algorithms on a PMP SurfaceMesh.
  Thanks to @afabri for contributing the changes!
- Add PMP_INSTALL option to CMake.
- Add PMP_BUILD_VIS CMake option to enable / disable building the pmp_vis
  library and its dependencies.

### Changed

- Build shared libraries on all platforms by default (except pmp_vis , see #87)
- Bump CMake minimum required version to 3.16.3
- Make SurfaceTriangulation::Objective a scoped enum
- Remove SurfaceMesh::triangulate() functions to avoid redundancy with SurfaceTriangulation
- Improve API by reporting errors using exceptions (see #16).
- SurfaceFeatures now returns the number of boundary / feature edges detected.
- Update Eigen to version 3.4.0
- Update googletest to version 1.11.0
- Update stb_image to version 2.26 and stb_image_writer to version 1.15.
- Update GLFW to version 3.3.5
- Change CMake policy CMP0072 to "NEW" behavior preferring GLVND

### Fixed

- Fix crash in SurfaceRemeshing when dealing with low quality meshes (#90, #89)
- `SurfaceMesh::bounds()` no longer includes deleted vertices. Thanks to Paul Du.
- Fix crash in SurfaceHoleFilling when a vertex selection already exists.
- Fix bug in SurfaceHoleFilling leading to artifacts in the filled surface patch. See #64.
- Change sign of vec2::perp() to correctly model CCW rotation by 90 degrees.
- Fix bug in OpenGL buffer clean-up in SurfaceMeshGL.

## [1.2.1] 2020-05-10

### Fixed

- Fix rendering issues around sharp edges
- Fix bug in adaptive remeshing leading to over-refinement of corner vertices.
- Fix bug in bounding box computation.
  Thanks a lot to Jascha Achenbach for reporting this bug!

## [1.2.0] 2020-03-15

### External libraries

- Upgrade Eigen to current master version to get rid of a compile error on Windows
- Upgrade ImGui to version 1.75
- Upgrade stb_image to current master version

### Added

- Add constructors using initializer lists to Matrix/Vector classes
- Add assignment from and cast from Eigen matrices and vectors
- Improved rendering of general polygons, avoiding erroneous
  tessellation into overlapping/flipped triangles in case of
  non-convex polygons.
- Added support for rendering using MatCaps.
  Thanks to Alec Jacobson for suggesting this!

### Fixed

- Fix erroneous header install path (visualization)
- Fix bug hole filling (when filling single-triangle holes).
  Thanks a lot to Pierre Buyssens for reporting this bug!
- Fix bug when fairing a mesh w/o boundary constraints.
  Thanks a lot to Pierre Buyssens for reporting this bug!

## [1.1.0] 2019-05-30

### Added

- Compile-time switch `PMP_SCALAR_TYPE` to choose between float/double as Scalar
- Support point set rendering for surface meshes without faces
- Add hole filling based on Liepa algorithm
- Add explicit warranty and liability disclaimer

### Changed

- Breaking change: Public members in Window and TrackballViewer classes made
  private and encapsulated through access functions
- Change SurfaceSmoothing to avoid model shrinking
- Improve normal computation for polygonal faces
- Upgrade GLFW to version 3.3
- Upgrade ImGui to version 1.70
- Upgrade Eigen to version 3.3.7
- Documentation updates

### Fixed

- Fix a bug in OFF reader when loading faces with high valence
- Fix a bug SurfaceGeodesic that lead to dist(v0,v1) != dist(v1,v0). As a
  consequence, the Novotni method has been removed from SurfaceGeodesic.
