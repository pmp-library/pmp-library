## [3.0.0] 2023-08-24

### Added

- Add `mesh_to_matrices()` and `matrices_to_mesh()` functions to convert to and from Eigen matrices.
- Add support to write binary STL files.
- Added `geodesics_heat()` for computing geodesics (based on the heat method) on general polygon meshes.
- Generalize curvature computation in `curvature()` to polygon meshes.
- Add `mean_edge_length(SurfaceMesh)`.
- Add `min_face_area()` to compute minimum face area of all faces.
- Add `edge_area()` to compute the area associated to an edge.
- Added circulator enumerating edges around vertex: `SurfaceMesh::edges(Vertex)`.
- Functions `laplace_matrix()`, `mass_matrix()`, `gradient_matrix()`, and `divergence_matrix()` that compute matrix representations of those discrete differential operators. Works for both triangle meshes and general polygon meshes, based on the paper Bunge et al, "Polygon Laplacian made simple", Eurographics 2020.
- Smoothing, parameterization, and fairing are now implemented based on sparse Laplacian matrices, which generalizes to general polygon meshes.
- Add `PMP_STRICT_COMPILATION` CMake option to control treating warnings as errors. Default: On.
- Add function `flip_faces()` to reverse face orientation in a mesh (#123)
- Meshes and textures can be loaded by dropping the files onto the window, both in normal GLFW windows and browser windows (using emscripten). Thanks to Stephan Wenninger!

### Changed

- Get rid of git submodules, vendor all third-party libraries for simplicity. See also #167.
- The function `voronoi_area()` now computes the barycentric Voronoi area, because this version generalizes better to polygon meshes. The mixed Voronoi area (for triangle meshes) is now computed by `voronoi_area_mixed()`.
- Consistently use lowercase file names
- Rename `Timer` to `StopWatch`
- `SurfaceMeshGL` renamed to `Renderer` and de-coupled from `SurfaceMesh`
- Replace `triangle_area(Face)` by `face_area(Face)`, which now supports general polygons. `surface_area(SurfaceMesh)` now also works for general polygon meshes.
- Remove max angle triangulation objective leading to fold-overs.
- Breaking change: Re-design algorithms API to use a simple function interface.
- Breaking change: Make helper classes `Heap`, `Quadric`, `NormalCone`, `TriangleKdTree` private.
- Remove `vertex_curvature()`, `VertexCurvature`, and `angle_sum()`.
- Support CMake's `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` option to control building shared libraries
- Fix `Mat3::inverse()` to use `fabs()`
- Remove `Matrix::allFinite()`.
- Make `SurfaceMesh::bounds()` a free function `pmp::bounds()`.
- Make `SurfaceMesh::edge_length()` a free function `pmp::edge_length()`.
- Remove object properties.
- Remove support for PLY format, see 1ec912b for why.
- Remove support for XYZ and AGI point set formats.
- Move `SurfaceMesh::read()` and `SurfaceMesh::write()` to free functions `pmp::read()` and `pmp::write()`.
- Move IO functionality into its own module
- Upgrade C++ standard to C++17
- Remove `PMP_ASSERT()` macro.
- Remove `get_*_property_type()` functions from `SurfaceMesh`
- Move example apps from `src/apps` to `examples`. Remove `PMP_BUILD_APPS` CMake option.
- Rename `Simplification` to `Decimation`
- Rename `Factory` to `Shapes`
- Drop `Surface` prefix from algorithms
- Update glew to version 2.2.0.
- Update stb_image to version 2.28 and stb_image_write to version 1.16.
- Upgrade ImGui to version 1.89.8
