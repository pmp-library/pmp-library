# Smoothing {#smoothing}

Mesh smoothing effectively reduces noise in the input surface. Especially meshes coming from 3D scanning and reconstruction typically contain noise.

PMP provides two different methods for smoothing:

1. Explicit Laplacian smoothing. See pmp::explicit_smoothing().
2. Implicit Laplacian smoothing. See pmp::implicit_smoothing().
