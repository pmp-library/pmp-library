![Smoothing and curvature computation on a quad mesh using a general polygon Laplacian.](/images/fandisk_quads.jpg)

We are pleased to announce version 3.0 of the Polygon Mesh Processing Library! This is a major release with several additions and API changes. Highlights include:

- We integrated a polygon Laplacian based on \cite bunge_2020_polygon . Several algorithms now work on general polygon meshes, including smoothing, parameterization, fairing, and curvature computation.
- The geodesics in heat method based on \cite crane_2013_geodesics has been added.
- The algorithms API has been revamped to use a simple function-based interface.
- New interactive online demos integrated into the [algorithms guide](https://www.pmp-library.org/algorithms-guide.html).
- We no longer use git submodules for handling third-party dependencies.
- Upgrade C++ standard to C++17
- ... a whole lot of smaller fixes, cleanups, and improvements

See the [changelog](https://github.com/pmp-library/pmp-library/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for a full summary of changes. Upgrading existing code from previous versions might require some changes due to the API rework we did. Please review the [changelog](https://github.com/pmp-library/pmp-library/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for any breaking changes that might affect you.
