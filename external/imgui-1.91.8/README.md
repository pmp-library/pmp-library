# Updating

This directory contains a subset of [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui), a bloat-free immediate mode GUI.

Note to our future selves: To update to a new ImGui version, copy the following files to this directory

```sh
cp imgui/LICENSE.txt imgui/*.{cpp,h} imgui/backends/imgui_implglfw.{cpp,h} imgui/backends/imgui_impl_opengl3* pmp-library/external/imgui/
```

Also include `CMakeLists.txt`, `lato-font.h`, and `pmp_imconfig.h`.
