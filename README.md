[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/pmp-library/pmp-library/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/pmp-library/pmp-library?branch=master)
[![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/pmp-library/pmp-library?sort=semver)](https://github.com/pmp-library/pmp-library/releases/latest)

The Polygon Mesh Processing Library is a modern C++ open-source library for processing and visualizing polygon surface meshes. Its main features are:

- An efficient and easy-to-use mesh data structure
- Standard algorithms such as simplification, remeshing, subdivision, or smoothing
- Ready-to-use visualization tools
- Seamless cross-compilation to JavaScript ([demo](https://www.pmp-library.org/mpview.html))

## Get Started

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/pmp-library/pmp-library.git
```

Configure and build:

```sh
cd pmp-library && mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make
```

Run the mesh processing app:

```sh
./mpview ../external/pmp-data/off/bunny.off
```

Build your own tool:

```cpp
#include <pmp/SurfaceMesh.h>

int main(void)
{
    pmp::SurfaceMesh mesh;
    mesh.read("input.obj");
    // .. do awesome things with your mesh
    mesh.write("output.obj");
}
```
